During my undergraduate, I spent a lot of time exploring myself and I found out my passion during my last year——learning and working with Statistics. We can't really go back in time, but we have choices every moment from now, that's why I created this section——to remark the choices that I had never made before.

### 8/10/2024: YYZ-RDU

First time in North Carolina, weather was not bad and everything went well, it was a good start.

### 8/11/2024: Built my first PC

Always want to try how it feels like to build a PC on my own, made a several mistakes in between, but eventually made it with help from some friends.
