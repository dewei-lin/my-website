Hello! My name is Dewei (duh-way) and I'm currently a Master student in [Biostatistics program at UNC Chapel Hill](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/). Before my journey in UNC, I studied Statistics, Economics and Philosophy at [University of Toronto, Scarborough Campus](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/home/), where I spent unforgettable three years.

I'm creating this website just for fun, my plan is to first work on a section "First time ever", and then add some more interesting contents to my website.
